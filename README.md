# Project for Programming (FEUP-L.EIC009)

## Basic Description

In this project you will use C++ to represent and process RGB color images with 8-bits per RGB channel. For that you will work (mainly) with 3 separate types of classes:
 * <prog::Color> to represent **RGB colors**;
 * <prog::Image> to represent **images** where individual pixels are represented by _Color_;
 * <prog::Script> to process scripts that contain **image manipulation commands**;
