# Project for Programming (FEUP-L.EIC009)

## Basic Description

In this project you will use C++ to represent and process RGB color images with 8-bits per RGB channel. For that you will work (mainly) with 3 separate types of classes:
 * <prog::Color> to represent **RGB colors**;
 * <prog::Image> to represent **images** where individual pixels are represented by _Color_;
 * <prog::Script> to process scripts that contain **image manipulation commands**;

Initial files are already provided and some of them mustn't (and needn't) be changed.

## Files to change and to-do list

> **Color Class**
  * Color.cpp: class implementation of Color.h
  * Color.hpp: header file for class declaration (Interface)
> **Image Class**
  * Image.cpp: class implementation of Image.h
  * Image.hpp: header file for class declaration (Interface)
> **Script Class**
  * Script.cpp: class implementation of Script.h
  * Script.hpp: header file for class declaration (Interface)
> **XPM2 Class (advanced functionality)**
  * XPM2.cpp: class implementation of Color.h
  * XPM2.hpp: header file for class declaration (Interface)
